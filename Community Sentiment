Positive Sentiment: The UBS has been praised for its affordability and potential for airdrop rewards, with comparisons to Solana’s Saga, where users earned significant returns. Partnerships and refunds have boosted community enthusiasm.

Criticism: Some users have expressed dissatisfaction, citing “backward features” and delays in airdrop delivery, with at least one user labeling the project a scam. These concerns highlight the challenges of meeting community expectations in a rapidly evolving Web3 space.

Regulatory Context: Telegram’s broader legal challenges, such as the 2024 questioning of its CEO in France over platform misuse, may indirectly affect perceptions of TON-based projects like the UBS, though no direct link to Oyster Labs has been reported.
