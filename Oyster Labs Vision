Oyster Labs aims to create a transformative Web3 ecosystem tailored for Telegramâ€™s massive user base. Key initiatives include:
Oyster DApp Suite: A collection of tools and applications to enhance Web3 accessibility.

Oyster ECO Fund: A $10M community syndicate investing in DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), hardware, and Telegram mini-apps, with 1-10% of tokens from funded projects reserved for UBS holders.

Soulbound NFTs: Exclusive NFTs like the Orbit NFT (limited to 5,000) and CEO Award (100 pieces) offer UBS holders additional airdrops and $OYS rewards.

Partnerships: Oyster Labs collaborates with projects like YCIYC (a token launch platform), TonTradingBot, Storm Trade, and Dmail Network, ensuring UBS users receive dividends, cashback, and early access to new tokens.
