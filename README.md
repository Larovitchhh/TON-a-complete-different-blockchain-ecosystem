TON a complete different blockchain ecosystem
The Telegram Open Network (TON) is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain platform originally developed by the Telegram team. TON aims to support millions of transactions per second with low fees, enabling a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and services like payments, storage, and DNS.
Unlike traditional blockchains, TON uses a sharded architecture and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus to achieve high throughput and efficiency, making it a distinct ecosystem for developers and users.
