Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username in the clone URL.

You can expand sections like contracts/ or examples/ with specific smart contracts or dApps as the repository grows.

If you want to include specific tools, frameworks, or TON-specific libraries (e.g., TON SDK, FunC compiler), let me know, and I can tailor the README further.

If you plan to add visual elements (e.g., a TON logo or architecture diagram), confirm if you'd like me to describe how to integrate them or suggest a placeholder.
